    // Note: Accessing static state in tests can sometimes make tests less isolated.
    // A more robust approach might be to dependency inject ExecutorService everywhere and test with a mock/test ExecutorService instance.
    // But to test that Main sets up the global ExecutorService, accessing it statically is necessary here.

    @BeforeAll // This method runs once before all test methods in this class

        // Running a minimal part of Main's initialization if the full Main.main is too complex
        // Or if Main.main is designed to run the GUI, maybe just call the part that initializes ExecutorService
        // For simplicity, if Main.main is the entry point that sets up everything, we might need to
        // structure it so initialization can be triggered without starting the full GUI.
        // Assuming Main.main() is called elsewhere (e.g., by your test runner setup if it exists)
        // If not, you might need a helper method in Main to just initialize the service:
        // public static void initializeExecutorService() { executorService = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(4); }
        // And call Main.initializeExecutorService() here.

        // Let's assume Main.main() is called by your test runner setup or you have a helper initializer.
        // If you run this test directly, and Main.main() hasn't run, getExecutorService() might be null.
        // A simple way to ensure it's not null for this test is to call Main.main()
        // or the initialization part, but this might start the GUI.
        // For now, let's assume getExecutorService() will return a non-null instance in your testing environment.

        // Alternative: Create a test ExecutorService just for this test class
